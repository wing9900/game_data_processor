The Spitfire is a heavily underrated plane in War Tycoon, being under the assumption of being extremely weak due to its status as a propeller plane. The plane is famous for its rapid turn rate even for its age, being able to out-turn modern aircraft like the F-14 Tomcat and the A-10 Warthog, making these jets extremely vulnerable to the high-damage cannons on the Spitfire.

The armament diminishes shields, aircraft, and even tanks, taking as little as two dives to completely destroy a full HP MAUS, being the tank with the highest health in the game, and being very difficult for planes and helicopters to destroy if not already low on HP. What makes it even more overpowered is the very long fire rate it has; it takes more than 10 seconds to go into cooldown and recharges rapidly if you stop firing the cannons before it hits the cooldown. This allows for a practically infinite source of ammo, and while your opponents are waiting for their cooldown to finish, they become an easy target to eliminate.

The only true weakness of the Spitfire is its slow speed compared to the other aircraft and its role as a propeller plane, not being able to chase down enemies across the map without veteran aim or vertically up into the sky, where it will stall and lose altitude. It is important that when in a dogfight with the Spitfire, you have as low an altitude as possible and have room to go full speed so you can climb up, fly fast and dive back on the Spitfire when far enough away from it.

Overall, this plane may take some practice to use correctly, for it can easily be defeated by modern aircraft, for it has unsurprisingly low HP compared to them, but it's worth noting that this plane is a large threat you'll need to confront in the skies.
