    "text_content": "The P-51 Mustang is regarded as one of the weakest and most vulnerable vehicles in the entire game due to having no flares. Since it's a plane, it does not have the luxury of having the maneuverability of helicopters to linger in their flares, avoid lock-on missiles, and counter anti-air vehicles such as the Pantsir S1 and Patriot AA, which are extremely effective against the P-51 and other planes. The P-51 Mustang is equipped with four 20mm cannons mounted to its wings, which function similarly to a machine gun due to their lower individual fire rate when compared to the rotary cannons mounted to other planes such as the F-4 Phantom, F-14 Tomcat, and F-16 Falcon to name a few. The P-51's 20mm cannons combined, however, deal significant damage-per-shot and are able to fire over a larger area with each cannon shooting in an alternating pattern to maximise fire rate and coverage. The P-51 Mustang also comes with a single .50 caliber machine gun mounted underneath the nose, which, although by itself has a limited effectiveness, when combined with the more powerful 20mm cannons, the .50 caliber provides extra attrition damage against enemy vehicles and exposed infantry. Much like its real-life counterpart, the P-51 Mustang serves as an effective plane for Close Air Support (CAS) roles. Its powerful Area of Effect (AoE) damage makes the platform well suited for engaging lightly armored vehicles and exposed infantry whilst also being able to finish off severely damaged tanks in specific circumstances. Evaluating this plane, if used correctly, the P-51 Mustang is a cheap, effective CAS aircraft but falters in other roles due to the divide between its skill requirements and effectiveness against other, more advanced planes."
